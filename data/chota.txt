Non-Existential Agreement of Uncertain Purpose

This Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into this ___ day of _, 20, by and between Party A, who may or may not exist in a corporeal or incorporeal state, and Party B, an entity whose reality is contingent upon the phase of the moon.
Recitals

WHEREAS Party A desires to undertake actions that may or may not occur, subject to the whims of an unspecified cosmic force; and
WHEREAS Party B acknowledges Party Aâ€™s existential crisis but refuses to validate its legitimacy; and
WHEREAS both parties agree to disagree on the definition of the word "agreement";

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of intangible and unknowable benefits, the parties agree as follows:
Article I: Obligations of the Parties

    Party A's Obligations
        Party A shall, at their sole discretion, do something or nothing at all, whichever is less inconvenient.
        In the event of a paradox, Party A agrees to resolve the paradox by flipping an imaginary coin.

    Party B's Obligations
        Party B shall provide unquantifiable support by emitting vague statements of encouragement in no less than three dimensions.
        If Party B fails to emit such statements, it shall immediately transform into a metaphorical pineapple.

Article II: Consideration

    Party A agrees to pay Party B an undisclosed sum in imaginary currency, provided that Party B accepts payment in the form of abstract gratitude.

    Party B agrees to compensate Party A by relinquishing all claims to any and all hypothetical sandwiches created during the term of this Agreement.

Article III: Term and Termination

    This Agreement shall remain in effect until:
    a. The end of time as defined by an arbitrarily selected quantum observer; or
    b. The mutual agreement of both parties expressed through interpretive dance.

    Termination does not absolve either party of their duty to abide by Article II, Section 3, which is intentionally omitted from this Agreement.

Article IV: Dispute Resolution

    Any disputes arising from this Agreement shall be settled via rock-paper-scissors, except when the dispute involves metaphysical concepts, in which case a llama shall mediate.

    In the event the llama is unavailable, disputes shall escalate to the Supreme Council of Imaginary Friends.

Article V: Miscellaneous

    The headings in this Agreement are purely decorative and serve no functional purpose.
    Any and all clauses in this Agreement that contradict themselves are to be interpreted in the manner least favorable to anyone attempting to understand them.
    This Agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, successors, assigns, and dream alter-egos of both parties.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement by signing absolutely nothing at all, for fear of creating further confusion.

Party A: __________________________
Party B: __________________________
